## Initital Ideas

I'm intrigued by the potential of an embedded AI-powered weather forecasting system, a technology that is rapidly gaining recognition among meteorologists for its precision. This system could warn pilots in real time about weather changes on their route or nearby. This tool could apply to civil aviation and to military aviation and thus on every type of aircraft.
Moreover, this project holds the potential for everyday use. AI-powered weather forecasting has already been proven to surpass human precision. It offers a more accurate and long-term weather forecast.

I've done some research and found a pretty interesting and detailed article on how an AI-powered weather forecast system would be beneficial to the aviation industry.
