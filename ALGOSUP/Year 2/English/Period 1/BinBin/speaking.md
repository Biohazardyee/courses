## TV Commercial

kia video
save the whales
the trees
the ice caps - ice age reference scratch
the rhinos
hard to be an eco-warrior but easy to drive as one

This ad was aired during the Super Bowl in 2017, USA are starting to strive to save the planet, in the middle of an oscillating ecological crisis.

"It's hard to be an eco-warrior"

Falcons vs Patriots - Super Bowl final 2017.

When watching the sequence in which a woman was hanging on to a tree, I immediately thought of Julia Butterfly Hill. She is known worldwide as she occupied a 200-foot redwood tall tree for 738 days. Despite this entertaining Super Bowl advertisement, my initial reaction was to be quite moderate as this video has a really marked political engagement that can be detrimental to some ecological activists because of the cliches it contains. In a nutshell, I really like this because of the various references.

It’s cliche, but it’s necessary, Americans need to change their mind about ecology.

The voice-over mentioned that “It’s hard to be an eco-warrior” I feel, it’s so hard to be ecologically correct, there’s so much to do, yet it’s so hard to apply it.

And do you remember that sea shepherd thing? She only came to save whales from them and she is the one getting injured. It just conveys the message that doing great actions is not rewarded in this world.

Rhinos, illegal hunting

We should do something about climate change, the melting of ice caps is a big problem, each year is worse than the last.

I think I’m gonna buy an electric car, so I’d drive as an eco-warrior, I’ll feel better.

Techcrunch
pied piper

shanon code, presentation is cringy, not prepared, long

huffmann crreated another comnpression code for jpeg

132gb 3d video file uncompressed
can we handle it? we'll find out

shit its hung,

is it stuck? 2 mins remaining

unstucks, 24gb comnpressed 1/4 of the file

should be twice as little

runs verification to check whats wrong, no errors compressed everything

5.2 validated score,  doubled the best score ever mesured before.

everyone is shocked

The first video takes place at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, an event organised each year, where new technology startups attend to launch their products and services.
3 friends from Pied Piper are presenting their data compression solution. Their initial presentation is cringy, not well prepared, not at ease at speaking. To show how unprepared they are, one of the guys takes the paper hand off his colleague.

They deal with the Shannon encoding which is a lossless data compression technique and how David Huffman came along and made it up to the bottom. Even they have no clue why they are talking about it,as they use other compression principles.

The judges to test their techniques hand them over a 132GB 3D video file, needing to be compressed.
At first, the compression doesn’t seem to work, it gets hung. They are unsure whether it will handle it.

The spokesperson tells them they have 2 minutes remaining. Magically, it unstuck and finishes the compression.

However, the compression is not as big as they thought, the final file size is 24GB. Which is ¼ of the initial file size.
The judges ask them to run a test to know what went wrong. Fortunately, everything went well. They have no loss of data nor data corrupted.
They end up with a 5.2 score and a whole file compressed, doubling the previous highest recorded score.

Note: It is in front of investors to launch their startup

### video 2

The second video takes place at the place of one of the developers, they play the famous game amongst developers “Always Blue”

The “Always Blue” game comes from the TV show Silicon Valley and features a ball known as the Hoberman Switch Pitch ball. When being thrown in the air, the ball has a 50% chance to turn either blue or yellow. The aim of the game is to have the longest streak of blue colours. This is a great distraction for developers after their tech challenges.
