## Write a procedure for washing dishes

You’re eating your favorite meal but just found out you need to do the dishes later? Don’t worry we got you.

1. Finish enjoying your meal
2. Once done, gather all the dishes together
3. Throw the left-overs in the bin, or give it to the nearest homeless person
4. Fill in the sink with warm water and some soap, until it bubbles
5. Put in your dishes
6. Grab a sponge, wet it and soap it
7. With the sponge, scrub the dish thoroughly, until it shines
8. Repeat step 7 for all of your dishes
9. Take a towel to dry everything up
10. Voila! 10 easy steps to wash your dishes

You now know how to wash your dishes safely, you can now repeat the whole process, everytime you eat or cook something succulent.

**Feedback:**

- too informal, too much unnecessary information.
- we’ve got your back.
- you’ve just found out.
- dish soap
- do a “this is what you need:” section

- drying rack
- keep procedures down to 9 steps. unless if installation guide

**Other feedback:**

- avoid passive voice,
- don’t be too redundant
- dont be too overkill
- KISS method, keep it sweet and simple

## How to write procedures

Procedure are a set of instructions professionals can use to explain processes within the workspace
A procedue is a step-by-step list of instructions to complete a specific task.
Before you begin writing the procedure:

1. Define the task that you want to document
2. Define the audience of the task.
3. List all the relevant materials you need to gather to exxecute the procedure succesfully in the order in which they will be used
4. Break the task down into clear and concise steps. Each step must be specific, action-oriented and ordered logically
5. Write in the second person, using simple language in the active voice
6. Limit the number of steps in your procedure to 9.

### Examples

- Recipe
- Experiment
- Instructions for a task

### What do you need?

- A title that explains the goal or outcome of the procedure
- Material or ingredients in a list

### Method

- Make sure you put steps are in the correct order
- Make each step short
- Use actions verbs, put them at the beginning of the step
- Put each step on a separate line and number each
- Add any tips advice or safety warnings

### Task Analysis

A task analysis can help you understand:

- Which tasks are the most important to users
- Which tasks they spend most time on
- Which tasks are more tedious or most trivial
- What type of organization is appropriate
- How much detail to include
- What kinds of examples to use
=> Defines the "WHY?"
Watch the user

### How to make information task oriented

To make information task oriented follow these guidelines:

- Write for the intended audience.
- Present information from the user's point of view.
- Focus on real tasks, not product functions.
- Indicate a practical reason for information.
- Use titles and heading that reveal the tasks.

1. A deposit shall be made with each proposal for the purchase of Indian Forest products. such deposits shall be at least:

- Ten percent if the appraised stumpage value is less than 100,000 dollars in any event not less than 1,000 dollars or full value whichever is less.
- Five percent if the appraised stumpage value is 100,000 dollars to 250,000 dollars but in any event not less than 10,000 dollars
- Three percent if the appraised stumpage value exceeds 250,000 dollars but in any event not less than 12,500 dollars.

**When proposing to purchase Indian Forest products, a deposit is required based on the appraised stumpage value. The following table outlines the deposit amounts and minimum requirements according to different value ranges:**

## Rewrite the document

The most common storage shortage problems involve KJH. MCAT uses large amounts of KJH for its control blocks and buffers containing data that is being sent around the network. This problem can be due to a variety of causes. For example, if one application is flooding another with data, and the second application is unable to receive the data and process it at an adequate rate, then the buffers build up in MCAT storage.

This situation can be avoided by using session pacing.
If MCAT is unable to get enough storage to issue a message, then the normal storage shortage message is accompanied by an IST999E
message.

FGHMP and QFRDT: The Primary return code
(FGHMP) and secondary return code (QFRDT)
are both given to DDF when an APPCCMD macro has completed. On occasion, these codes may indicate that there is a storage shortage in MCAT. For example, if FGHMP is x'0037' and QFRDT is x'0000', then this indicates a storage shortage while MCAT was receiving data or sending a pacing response.

A FGHMP of x'0093' with QFRDT of x'0000' indicates there is a temporary storage shortage while sending data. Usually this return code means that the send request has temporarily depleted the buffer pool to such an extent that the pool must be expanded. The expansion had not occurred before the completion of the APPCCMD macro.
SNA sense code: Some SNA sense codes indicate there may be a storage shortage also.

For example, a user might be accessing data from the remote database, and receive 037C0000. Checking this sense code in the manual indicates that there is a permanent insufficient resource condition. This resource could be storage. Other sense codes, such as 3004000 indicate a storage type problem, but not necessarily a storage shortage.

Errors: There are a series of PJL errors which indicate storage shortage problems. For example, ERROR373 and ERROR30A. These are uncammon in MCAT.

Hangs: Depending on the storage shortage and the processing that is occurring, the storage shortage could manifest itself in a hang situation For example, if a virtual route becomes blocked due to storage shortages, then all the sessions that had been using that session hangs until the storage shortage is relieved and the virtual route becomes open again. When any of these indications of a storage problem is received, the following steps can be used to find out more information about the shortage:

Determine the area of storage shortage. This is important, as the MCAT display command has information about the MCAT KJH usage. This does not help diagnosis if the storage shortage is in MCAT private. However, perhaps KJH usage should probably be checked anyway.
Display buffer usage: If the storage shortage has occurred in one of the KJH subpools, then a
"P SET,DCVRF" command can be used to determine the amount of KJH storage being used by MCAT. Usually the buffer use display gives a good dea of which MCAT pool is causing the storage shortage.

Monitor buffer usage: When looking at a buffer shortage, it is often helpful to know whether the onset of the problem was gradual or immediate.
If regular buffer usage displays are done, then gradual increases in buffer use can be seen.
These gradual increases may take days 10 manifest themselves into storage shortage problems. In fact, if MCAT is taken down regularly, the storage shortage symptom may never been seen.

Another benefit of regular monitoring of the buffers is that when a problem does occur
"normal" buffer usage for that host is known, so some comparison of the buffer values can be done.

If the onset of the buffer shortage is very fast, then check the system console (or log), looking for some event that has triggered this problem.
This could be virtually anything. For example, an BJX has a problem and large amounts of data that was heading out onto the network is now

### Storage Shortage in MCAT: Causes and Solutions

The Master Control Application Tool (MCAT) can experience storage shortages due to various factors, such as excessive data transmission between applications or delays in data processing, which cause buffers to fill up. To mitigate this, session pacing can be implemented to regulate data flow. When MCAT encounters storage shortages while sending messages, it triggers a storage shortage message, often accompanied by an IST999E error message.

#### Symptoms of Storage Shortages

Hangs: Storage shortages can cause virtual routes to become blocked, leading to session hangs. Sessions remain blocked until the shortage is resolved.

Error Messages: When a storage shortage occurs, MCAT issues an IST999E message, signaling the need for more resources.

#### Common Errors Related to MCAT Storage Shortages

Here are some common error codes that indicate storage shortages, along with their descriptions and potential solutions:

| **Error/Code**             | **Description**                                                                                     | **Solution/Notes**                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FGHMP x'0037' & QFRDT x'0000'** | Indicates a storage shortage while receiving data or sending a pacing response.                      | Investigate MCAT storage usage and buffers, possibly reallocate resources.                                   |
| **FGHMP x'0093' & QFRDT x'0000'** | Temporary storage shortage during data transmission; buffer pool has been depleted.                  | Wait for buffer pool expansion. If recurrent, consider increasing the buffer pool size.                      |
| **SNA sense code 037C0000** | Indicates a permanent insufficient resource condition, possibly due to storage shortages.            | Check for resource allocation issues, especially related to storage.                                         |
| **SNA sense code 3004000**  | Indicates a storage-related issue, but not necessarily a shortage.                                  | Review system resources and confirm proper allocation to avoid further issues.                               |
| **PJL ERROR373**            | Uncommon error indicating a storage shortage.                                                        | Investigate KJH buffer pools and subpools for abnormalities.                                                 |
| **PJL ERROR30A**            | Uncommon error associated with storage shortages.                                                    | Same as above: review MCAT subpools and buffer utilization for possible corrective actions.                  |

### Troubleshooting Storage Shortages

To troubleshoot storage shortage issues in MCAT, follow these steps:

1. Identify the Storage Pool by using the `P SET, DCVRF` command to display KJH storage subpools.

2. Monitor Buffer Usage: Monitoring buffer growth over time can indicate whether additional resources are needed.

3. Expand Buffer Pool

4. Check for System Events

5. Reallocate Resources

By regularly monitoring MCAT storage and addressing buffer usage, storage shortages can be minimized, leading to more efficient system operation and reduced downtime.
