## BAR Method

- Background: Where you are in the application and what you want to do
- Action: The action that you must perform
- Result: The result of the action and the result of all the actions you have performed in the procedure

## Mentioned In Class

The following type of list dominate technical writing:

- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists
- Embedded lists

Use a bulleted list for unordered items; use a numbered list for ordered items:

• If you rearrange the items in a bulleted list, the list's meaning does not change
• If you rearrange the items in a numbered list, the meaning of the list changes.

• Numbered procedures
• Complete sentences
• Imperative verb form
• Consistent sentence structures
• Capitalize the first word in each step
• Always use a phrase when you need to tell the customer where to start. The
rest of the time, start each sentence with a verb.
• Use a period after each step
• Limit a procedure to seven steps and preferably fewer.
• Use parallel structure

## Style Sheets

As professional writers know, writing pieces cycle through the various
writing stages multiple times before being completed. To ease the
transition between these processes and to develop consistent methods,
especially when collaborating with others, technical writers will rely on a
tool kit of systems and approaches. Each writer and editor stocks their tool
kit with the equipment, or methodology, that works best for them and their
client.

Regardless of your preferences, it is still beneficial to be familiar with the
foundational tools that technical writers and editors depend on to produce
credible work. Style sheets and style guides are two free tools that every
writer and editor can leverage to improve the consistency of the work they
produce and review.

A style sheet is a quick reference for a specific document that outlines the major design, style and formatting standards that should be uniform throughout the writing piece. Since style sheets are referenced regularly, the
sheet should ideally be one page or up to three pages for larger works.

The main purpose is to help you or others locate information quickly. It should feature brief statements, bullet points, and key ideas or reminders.

A style sheet can be used by many people or by one person. Adapt the content
based on the information the users need to be reminded of the most.

It gives an entrance to where you can find more information.

### Examples of Style Sheets

Some examples of what may appear on a style sheet include:

• Words that should be hyphenated
• Abbreviations and what they stand for
• Whether numbers are written or spelled out
• Citation standards
• Typeface / format specifications

### Keep It Accessible

Consider keeping it at an easily accessible location. Laminating or hanging a hard copy above one's work area is a great way to ensure the reference is preserved and readily available. Digital files can also be saved to the desktop or pinned to one's ribbon bar if located online. online shopping

They are commonly used to save time, the document has its limitations. For instance, they do not contain all of the editors' or writers' standards.

## Style Guides

Style guides are a comprehensive resource for documenting all project-specific standards. \
Think of the style guide as a more in-depth version of the
style sheet.

Similar to the style sheet, the style guide promotes consistency across documents or sections of a document, guides the reader through the document, and saves writers time by preventing questions on varying stylistic or grammatical choices. Ideally, a style guide should be broken into sections that address specific standards.

### Examples of Style Guides

Sections that a style guide might include appear below:
• Grammar / punctuation guidelines
• Citation guidelines
• Formatting guidelines
• Style / layout guidelines
• Design / brand guidelines

Because the style guide is a more comprehensive resource, it can be lengthy depending on how specific or detailed the writing must be.

This resource is particularly useful in the field of knowledge management where several writers and editors are collaborating on company documents.

Company documents support the business’s brand recognition, which requires consistent use of company logos, colors, formatting standards, and language.

## How To Use Each

Both style sheets and style guides are used to maintain uniformity,enforce company or personal writing standards, and guide readers through a document.
How they are used and developed mainly depend on the writer or editor. Some may find it easier to develop these tools before starting a project while others may find it more rewarding to develop one with a client or stakeholder.

Furthermore, non-fiction writers and editors are not the only ones who benefit from creating and referencing a style sheet or guide. Fiction writers and editors find them helpful for recording character details such as one’s physical appearance, personality traits, nicknames, plot-altering events, and more.

## What to Put In a Style Sheet

Citation Style is a set of guidelines on how to cite sources in your writing. You always need a citation whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize a source to avoid plagiarism. How you present the citations depends on the style you follow.

Examples: APA, MLA, Chicago

The clearest identifying characteristic of any citation style is how the citations in the text are presented. There are three main approaches:

- **Parenthetical citations:** include identifying details of the source in parentheses in the text—usually the author’s last name and the publication date, plus a page number if relevant (author-date). Sometimes the publication date is omitted (author-page).

- **Numerical citations:** You include a number in brackets or in superscript, which corresponds to an entry in your numbered reference list.

- **Note citations:** You include a full citation in a footnote or endnote, which is indicated in the text with a superscript number or symbol.

**Citation styles** also differ in terms of how you format the reference list or bibliography entries themselves (e.g., capitalization, order of information, use of italics). And many style guides also provide guidance on more general issues like text formatting, punctuation, and numbers.

**Reference list**

Example: Place at end of each chapter

**General Style**

Example: Written in the present tense.

### Learning Objectives

Example: There is a Learning Objective page at the beginning of each case study.

Example: This page begins with a paragraph or two of introductory text.

Example: The text is followed by a list of learning objectives placed in the LO textbox.

• Learning objectives begin with this statement: “In this case, learners have an opportunity to:”
• Learning objectives are listed using a numbered list.
• There should be no period at the end of each listed learning objective.

### Headings, Labels, and Tables

#### Headings and Labels

Example: Chapter titles should use title-case
Example: Chapter section titles should use sentence-case and Heading 1

#### Tables

Example: Column labels should be centered.

Select a font and font size for each.

### Capitalization and Punctuation

#### Capitalization

Example: Generic names for medications should be lower case. Brand names should be capitalized.

#### Punctuation

Example: Use serial comma
Example: Use italics for internal dialogue, i.e. when individual is thinking about something, e.g., She thought to herself, I wonder what he’s up to.

## Technical Writing Standards

### Style and Format

When writing technical documents, engineers rely on style manuals, which provide standards for writing and designing documents. Style manuals ensure consistency in writing and formatting documents written for academic or workplace communications.

Academic disciplines, including academic journals, have their own style manuals. These style manuals are used in the production of theses, dissertations, or journal articles.

Organizations use company-specific style manuals that contain guidelines for producing technical documents, business correspondence, professional presentations, and visual features (trademarks and logos). Document format and punctuation rules are commonly found in these style manuals. Company-specific style manuals often contain templates, which are used when creating written technical documents (progress or status reports, design reports, proposals, etc.), correspondence (letters, memos, and emails), or presentation slides.

### General Format Guidelines

The following guidelines represent generally accepted technical writing guidelines. As a reminder, guidelines may change based on the discipline, professor, employer, or journal the document is written for.

Technical documents typically contain:

- Single spacing
- Left justification; full justification is preferred for theses, dissertations, and journal articles.
- One blank line between paragraphs OR indented paragraphs with no blank line between
- Serif font (Times New Roman), 12 pt. font size. When documents are written for electronic media, however, a Sans Serif font (Calibri or Arial) is typically used.
- One-inch margins. Margins may need to be adjusted when using company letterhead or when binding formal reports.

### Stylistic Elements

Writers of technical information take into account the audience’s level of knowledge regarding the topic and the purpose of the document. In other words, “Why does the reader need this information and what will they do with it?” The following guidelines help writers achieve a readable style.

#### Acronyms and Abbreviations

Abbreviations are shortened forms of words such as ASME for American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Acronyms are formed when the abbreviation forms a pronounceable word such as NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Abbreviations and acronyms should be spelled out the first time they appear in a technical document with the shortened form appearing in parentheses immediately after the term. The abbreviation or acronym can then be used throughout the paper.

Example: The Society for Technical Communication (STC) is a professional association dedicated to the advancement of technical communication, content, and information management.

Common abbreviations (U.S.) or acronyms (NASA) do not need to be spelled out when first used in a document.

#### Ambiguity

Ambiguity occurs when words or passages can be interpreted in more than one way. Abstract language, misplaced modifiers, and vague pronoun reference can cause ambiguity. To make writing clear, avoid:

- abstract language (really, quite, severely, very)
- overusing pronouns, particularly it, these, and this
- imprecise or subjective terms (fast, slow, tall, small)
- words that have no precise meaning (bit)

#### Analogies and Metaphors

Analogies and metaphors in useful in technical writing to illustrate abstract or complicated ideas by making comparisons between two generally unlike things.

Example:

“When two atoms approach each other at great speeds, they go through one another, while at moderate speeds, they bound off each other like two billiard balls.”

Sir William Bragg

#### Audience

Writing with the intended audience(s) in mind is one of the most fundamental concepts of technical writing. Many technical documents will not only be read by the first person (primary audience) but may also be read by secondary audiences: readers in various levels of management, prospective financiers, or even individuals who access information without the writer’s knowledge.

#### Cliches

Cliches, or figures of speech, are terms that have no concrete meaning and can affect the tone and professionalism of a document. Cliches should be avoided in technical writing. Examples include:

Examples:

water under the bridge
writing on the wall
easier said than done
close the deal

#### Conciseness

Concise documents convey meaning using the fewest words possible without sacrificing meaning or clarity. To achieve conciseness:

- Eliminate empty/wordy phrases (there is/are and it is). These are considered to be indirect phrases and tend to be unclear and wordy. Direct statements, on the other hand, are clear and concise.

- Write using the active voice

- Avoid using weak verbs

- Eliminate filler words (very, quite, really, somewhat, that)

#### Contractions

Contractions are shortened forms of words with the missing letters represented by an apostrophe such as “you’ll” for “you will” or “didn’t” for “did not.” Contractions are unprofessional and informal and should be avoided in most technical documents.

#### Gender-Neutral Terms

Avoid specifying gender when possible. Gender specific language can create stereotypes, make generalizations, and exclude gender. Individuals should not be referred to solely as he or she. To achieve gender neutrality:

- Use generic terms when referring to specific groups of people (“supervisors”)
- Avoid gender-specific pronouns (“his” or “her”)
- Use gender-neutral titles when referring to people “(sales representatives” not “salesmen”

#### Headings

In technical reports, headings are used to organize documents, guide the reader, and break content into manageable chunks of information. Readers often peruse headings and read those sections that pertain to them.

Headings organize content into large sections (major headings) and then into smaller sections (sub-headings). Headings are formatted by level (first level, second level, third level, etc.) and vary in their position and formatting. Discipline- and employer-specific style manuals will provide guidelines in the placement and visual layout of headings. Headings vary in the type of information they provide:

- Brief topic headings use short words or phrases
  - Example: College Applications
- Statement headings use sentences or phrases and are more informational in nature.
  - Example: College Application Process
- Question headings are useful when writing documents that explain how to do something.
- Example: How do I Apply for College?

When using headings:

- Construct headings in a parallel fashion
- Try to avoid starting headings with a, an, or the
- Aim for at least two headings at each level; avoid dividing a section into a single sub-section if possible
- Avoid repeating the wording of a higher-level heading in a sub-heading
- Use headings to create the table of contents (if applicable to the document)

#### Jargon

Jargon is often called professional slang and consists of terms specific to a particular organization. Examples of jargon include terms like “flame” or “FUBAR.” Jargon sets members of an organization apart from non-members. When communicating with individuals who are likely to be unfamiliar with jargon, avoid using the term.

#### Lists

Lists are useful in technical writing for three purposes: to write a series of related items, to describe a series of tasks, and to make items visually accessible. Lists can be written in a sentence (as in the previous sentence) or set off from the text vertically. Items listed vertically are prefaced with a bullet, number, or checkmark. Bulleted lists make items easy to see or locate, numbered lists organize steps in a process, and checklists communicate items that need are required or need to be completed.

Lists are prefaced with a lead-in phrase (Items to review for the training:) or sentence (The following topics will be reviewed at the training:)

Key points to keep in mind when creating lists:

- Lists should be constructed in a parallel fashion.
- Lists comprised of brief items typically contain no ending punctuation.
- Lists with no sequence required should be arranged logically (most to least important, alphabetical)
- Lists written as full sentences should use appropriate ending punctuation.

#### Parallelism

Parallelism means using the same structure for listed items. These items can occur in a sentence, in a table, in a bulleted or numbered list, or in headings. Sentences with parallel structure are easier to read and flow more smoothly.

Not Parallel: “In heat and mass transfer class, students learned about modelling heat equations, dimensioning for thermal design, and how to analyze results.”

Parallel: “In heat and mass transfer class, students learned about modelling heat equations, dimensioning for thermal design, and analyzing results.”

When creating a bullet list, all items in the list should be parallel in construction.
