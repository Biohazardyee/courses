### Reorganizing Layers

To change the order of layers in your image:

1. Select the layer you want to move.  
2. Use the **Move Layer** drop-down menu:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Layer Visibility

To toggle visibility, follow these steps:

1. Identify the **Layers Panel** on the right side of the screen.  
2. Click the checkbox next to the layer you want to toggle visibility for.  

   - If the checkbox is checked, the layer will be **visible**.  
   - If the checkbox is unchecked, the layer will be **hidden**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Saving an Image

Saving your image ensures that your progress and modifications are not lost. Follow these instructions to save your work effectively:

### Steps to Save Your Image

1. Click on the **Save** button located at the top-left corner of the screen or simultaneously press command + S / Windows + S.  
   ![Save Button](../images/image-28.png)

   - This will overwrite your current file with the modified version.

### Important Notes

- **Overwriting Warning**:  
   Saving directly will replace the original file with your modified version. If you want to preserve the original, make a copy of the file before editing.  

- **File Location**:  
   The saved file will be stored in the same location as the original imported file, unless specified otherwise.  

By saving regularly, you can ensure your work is secure and avoid accidental data loss.
