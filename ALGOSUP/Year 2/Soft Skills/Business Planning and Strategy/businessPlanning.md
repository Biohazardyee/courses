## Business Plans

### Introduction to business plan

Business planning is the process of setting goals, defining strategies and outlining the steps to achieve them. It's not only the goals, but how and what we will do to achieve those goals.

### Why it matters for IT engineers

- Aligning IT projects with organizational objectives: work fluently to remove possibilities of conflict and understand the business objectives
- Justifying investments in technology: we should be able to say how much something can cost and justify why.
- Enhancing cross-functional communication

### The role of IT engineer in business planning

Bridging the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. Make the non technical understand the technical parts.

Examples:

- Estimating costs for IT infrastructure
- Identifying technical risks in strategic initiatives
- Proposing innovative technology solutions

We need a contingency plan.

#### Executive summary

Snapshot of the plan's purpose and key points

example of IT projects:

- Goal: Implement a new CRM system to improve customer retention
- Key benefit: Boosting efficiency and client satisfaction

We don't put the risk here, because there is a dedicated part, but it doesn't make sense to put the risk on the first page showcasing the problems. It could draw the investors away

IT engineers' contribution:

#### Funding request

Detailing the amount needed and its use.
