## From Consumer To Actor

Jihane Billacois - LinkedIn

## Introduction

Infobesity - lot of information on the internet

Filter bubbles - search history, bias, algorithms \
algorithms reinforce blind spots and bias. \
We have the natural tendency to seek what validates our feelings and opinion. The economy of attention feeds that need and create silos.

When you're certain you're right, question yourself.

We should consciously decide.

**What you don't see is what will make you trip**:

- Develop our ability to choose what we see
- Our curiosity and critical thinking

## Understanding Information

What is information?

Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom

You have data (how many voters vote for Trump) synthesize data to get information, Information (Trump won). \
Link data to get information. \
Add bricks of information to create knowledge, it is built long term when you have a lot of information, if you have good knowledge, you can reach wisdom.

Is content information? \
Content can be information but not necessarily.

### From the greeks to our journalist

Heritatis - 500 B.C \
Explain date by the cultural, the type of language and goes on the terrain

tech journal, talk about hardware, test which is the best, if they sell to business, editorial line isn't the same if they sell to consumers

The best way to communicate an information is when it is implied.

### How information is shared

- crawlers, little bot jumping from site to site, follow all links, in and out. And keywords.
- indexing: all the information gathered is indexed, put into a memory
- ranking: most likely to be useful, however, nah, what paid more, what has the best keywords. Might not answer your question, but has the keywords

## How to search information

The crime scene method:

- What
- Why
- Where
- When
- Who

Apply your filter:

- by choosing the right tool
- knowing how it works

open source data to gather information
in google "word", tells google to search these words together, put AND to search both, or one or the other. site: .edu searches for all article with .edu

Validate your results:

- Type of source - purpose
- Author - other information
- Date - localization

Cross-reference your results:

- Verify elements of the result outside
- other answer with different perspective

Everyone has their own definition, information and data is not black & white. Multiple things, being described oppositely could be true.

## Burst your bubble

### The human factor

## Consume to actor

- Zotero

## Shape before you share

Write Information that are:

- Accurate
- Easy to understand
- Relevant Information

### 3 ideas

the terms - terminology

the ideas - organization

the style - adaptation
