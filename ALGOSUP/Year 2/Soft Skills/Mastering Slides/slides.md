## IMPACT Method

- I: Intention
- M: Message
- P: Public
- A: Arguments
- C: Conception
- T: Talents

### Intention

Not something necessarily said to the audience, but we need to be clear about it.

You (personally), you have a point of view. \
Them, they have an issue, they expect something

Your point of view + their issue

Why am I communicating, why should they listen?

| The issue | Your point of view                      | The stakes for your audience          | Intention                                                                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GraviLift | GraviLift is a great piece of equipment | Profitability - Productivity - Safety | Convince them that our revolutionary solution is great to increase their profitability, productivity and safety |

### Message

Something that has meaning and people can understand.

1. Inform
2. Build Awareness
3. Motivate
4. Get Action

The message has to do smthg with the action of the audience

| Intention                                                                                                       | Action expected from the audience | Core message                                                              |

| Convince them that our revolutionary solution is great to increase their profitability, productivity and safety | Buy our solution                  | invest in the solution to increase profitability, productivity and safety |

#### 'So that' ladder

I'm making a presentation so that... and repeat as many steps as possible

And do the same for the purpose

I'm making a sales presentation so that I can demonstrate the unique capabilities of GraviLift, so that my audience understands that it is compact, robust, and easy to use, so that they recognize how it simplifies operations and enhances workplace efficiency, so that they see its direct impact on profitability and reduced work-related health issues, so that they realize the long-term benefits for their company, including lower costs and higher productivity, so that they are convinced itâ€™s a worthwhile investment, so that they decide to purchase and implement it in their operations, so that their company thrives with improved performance and employee well-being, so that their management sees tangible success and rewards their efforts, so that employees feel more valued and motivated, so that overall workplace satisfaction and happiness increase, so that the company maintains long-term growth and success.
