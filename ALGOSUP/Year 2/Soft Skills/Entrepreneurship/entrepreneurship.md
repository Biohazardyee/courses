## Unit 1: Exploring Entrepreneurship and Ideation

### Two Examples to Understand the Inception of Entrepreneurial Ideas

#### Airbnb

Two friends struggled to pay their rent in San Francisco, so they rented out three air mattresses and offered breakfast to guests. Due to the interest from guests, they launched a blog with listings called AirBedAndBreakfast.com. They later incorporated Airbnb and entered Y Combinator in 2009. The company now has an $80 billion market cap.

#### Spotify

In the early 2000s, piracy was rampant in the music industry, leading to shrinking revenues for labels and artists. Daniel Ek believed he could create an affordable, high-quality service for users while fairly compensating the music industry. Spotify was founded with a freemium business model that allowed unlimited listening, unlike iTunes. Launched in the USA in 2011, Spotify now boasts 640 million monthly active users and a $102 billion market cap.

### Conclusion

Entrepreneurial ideas often stem from identifying a problem. Entrepreneurs think of a problem they want to solve and then build a solution around it.

## The Problem/Solution Framework

Instead of focusing on an idea, concentrate on the problem you want to solve with a solution.

### Problem Criteria

- **Significant**: Strong enough to warrant attention.
- **Massive**: A problem affecting many people.
- **Solvable**: A problem that has viable solutions.

### Solution Criteria

- **Feasible**: A solution that can be realistically built.
- **Valuable**: A solution that can be monetized.
- **Scalable**: A solution that can be expanded or spread.

### Airbnb

The hospitality industry struggled to meet the growing demand for affordable and unique accommodations. Travelers were often limited to expensive, standardized hotel rooms, especially during peak seasons, leaving little flexibility for budget-conscious or experience-driven individuals seeking personalized stays.

### Spotify

In the music industry, no middle ground existed; high prices led many to resort to illegal piracy. This created a demand for a more accessible music streaming platform.

## 5 statements to have in mind on entrepreneurial ideas

1. Dn't fall in love with your idea: fall in love with the problem you want to solve
2. It's highly probable that you're not the only one to have this idea
3. You'd better not keep your idea to yourself: talking to others is often profitable
4. Genius is on percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration - T. Edison
5. whatever we conceive well we express clearly, and words flow with ease. - N. Boileau

## The Golden Circle

Before considering how and what you are doing, it's essential to understand **WHY** you are doing it. This understanding is crucial in business because it resonates with people's emotions when selling. Customers are more inclined to buy into your vision and purpose rather than just the product itself. When they see a connection between your "why" and their own values, they are more likely to engage and invest in what you offer.

This framework helps you present your entrepreneurial idea in a structured, concise, and adjustable way:

- **WHY**: Why is your idea special? Why does it stand out from what exists?
- **HOW**: How does your idea work? What is the mechanism behind value creation?
- **WHAT**: What is it you sell with your idea? Which tangible product or service do you offer?

### Airbnb

- **WHY**: Creating a community of travelers and hosts who want to share experiences and human connections, making people feel at home anywhere in the world.
- **HOW**: Connecting customers and hosts through a tech platform, while fostering trust and transparency via a two-sided rating system.
- **WHAT**: Allowing people to rent a room, an apartment, or a house anywhere in the world.

### Spotify

- **WHY**: Building a cultural platform that unlocks the potential of human creativity, empowering anyone to discover, enjoy, and share music without limits.
- **HOW**: Allowing artists to live off their art through a tech platform that provides fans with an inspiring and seamless way to support and enjoy their favorite music.
- **WHAT**: Streaming millions of music tracks while paying an affordable monthly fee.

## Value Proposition

A value proposition is a synthetic statement which defines the added value a product or service has for the customer it is sold to

### Examples

**Airbnb**:

Airbnb offers travelers unique accommodations for a fair price, anywhere in the world, and helps them experience human connection with the hosts

**Spotify**:

Spotify provides to listeners unlimited access to millions of high quality music tracks, for an affordable monthly fee and through an high-end user experience.

### Key Takeaways

- **Know your customer**

To have a strong value proposition, you must understand well who are your personas: the beneficiaries you're giving value to

- **Provide benefits or relive painstaking**

Good value propositions don't have to be the ones which you win more: they can be ones with which you lose less.

- **Build something unique**

The best value propositions give measurable and demonstrable benefits or reliefs in a way which differentiates from alternatives.

## Value Proposition Canvas

![1738074633626](image/entrepreneurship/1738074633626.png)

Start with the customer (right) part first; don't assume the solution exists before listing items on the customer part of the canvas.

### Customer Segment

- **Persona**:
  - Customer or beneficiary (not necessarily the one who pays, and not always the user).
- **Gains**:
  - Positive outcomes or benefits that provide satisfaction or joy to the customer.
- **Pains**:
  - Negative feelings or challenges the customer experiences while performing a task.

Once you've mapped and understood the persona, you can now focus on the left part.

### Value Proposition

Build your product or service to:

- **Relieve Pains**:
  - Address and alleviate the challenges faced by the persona.
- **Enhance Gains**:
  - Create additional value and positive outcomes based on the persona's needs and desires.

Ensure that the left part of the canvas aligns with the fundamental aspects identified on the right side. This alignment is crucial for crafting a compelling value proposition that resonates with your target audience.

### Application of the value proposition canvas for the artists of Spotify

  - customer job: make the music, create the lyrics and the beat, record the music, release the music, create an album, growing their fame, perform concert, earn money
  - Pains: Illegal music downloads, piracy, scammed by labels, find a label, find partnerships,lack channels for exposure, no specific feedback
  - Gains: exposure, gain money, show their art, having groupies, independence
