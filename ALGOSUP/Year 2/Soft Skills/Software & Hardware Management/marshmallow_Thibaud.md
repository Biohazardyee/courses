# Day 2

## Marshmallow Challenge

### How did I feel?

- Confident
- Integrated
- Listened to
- Bit stressed about the countdown

### How did I contribute

I shared ideas during the project, both during brainstorming and as we progressed. We communicated clearly as a team, and I focused on anticipating potential issues. My primary contribution was working on the base of the tower, aiming to make it as stable as possible.

Each of us leveraged our strengths to contribute effectively, ensuring we made the most of our collective effort. Although we didn’t assign specific roles, we naturally gravitated toward tasks where we were most effective at.

### What worked well/badly

#### Well

- Communication
- Risk assessment
- stability of the tower
- task attribution
- team cohesion
- team work
- (pre-)planning
- use of resources

#### Bad

- Tape was not as effective as we thought.
- Unfortunately, we didn’t achieve the tallest tower.

### What lesson have I drew from this

Communication and pre-planning are crucial. Building the architecture as we went along wasn’t the best approach; instead, we needed to design it beforehand. Identifying potential risks (like spaghetti breaking or the marshmallow being too heavy for the structure) was instrumental in solving these problems.

We prioritized creating a durable, stable base and tower, which could support the marshmallow for as long as possible. While we took some risks, we ensured they were measured, striking a balance between ambition and stability.

## Problems Encountered during previous projects

- lazy people deciding not to contribute - every project
- setting too high of a scope, leading to unfinished projects - pretty much every projects
- lack of testing outside of the school - pretty much every projects
- lack of communication - twice
- lack of actual project time so far - current project
- lack of communication with the client - "Sportshield" + "AdoptACAndidate"
