## A teammate does not do his attributed task(s)

### Default Model

**Circumstances**: A teammate was assigned the task of reviewing a document, with a deadline set a week in advance. However, the task was not completed.  

**Thoughts**: *They’re probably too lazy or careless to do it. Maybe they’re intentionally trying to mess things up.*  

**Emotions**: Frustrated, angry, and impatient. I feel tense and distracted, unable to focus on my own tasks.  

**Actions**: Send an aggressive or critical message to the teammate, creating conflict and a tense atmosphere within the team.  

**Result**: Team morale declines, collaboration becomes strained, and the task takes even longer to complete. The end product suffers in quality.

### Intentional Model

**Circumstances**: A teammate was assigned the task of reviewing a document, with a deadline set a week in advance. However, the task was not completed.  

**Thoughts**: *They might be overwhelmed with their workload or facing unexpected challenges that prevented them from completing the task.*

**Emotions**: Understanding, empathetic, and solution-focused. I feel motivated to address the situation constructively.  

**Actions**: Reach out to the teammate to discuss the situation calmly, offer assistance, and collaboratively explore ways to lighten their workload or adjust priorities to ensure the task gets done.  

**Result**: The teammate feels supported and becomes more effective. Team morale improves as trust and collaboration strengthen. The task is completed more efficiently, leading to a higher-quality final product.
