## Introduction

Rust is a Low level programming language released in 2006, but what if I tell you that this language can revolutionize Web development!
Rust is most famously known to be the main language of the Linux operating system. It has been used to develop Device Drivers, Kernel, performance critical components, the core of a computer can be developed with Rust.
However, it has never been widely used for web development, but, this usage is slowly growing, because there's multiple advantages to it.

**To what extent can Rust be useful to web development?**
We will answer this question by going through three mean parts:
Firstly, we will take about Rust's overall performance for development and web development, we will compare Rust to other languages and how the language impact the performance for web development.

Secondly, we will talk about Rust's security, we will see what features Rust have to improve the security of software, web pages and databases.

Thirdly and lastly, we will deal with how Rust will impact the future of web development.

## Rust x Performance

Firstly, Rust is a performant, fast executing and optimized language and there's multiple reason to it.

Rust is a low level programming language and this is a first advantage. Low level programming language provides minimal abstraction from the hardware's instruction. They're typically used  because they offer a close manipulation of the device hardware and direct control over system's resources. As previously said low level programming language are often used in software programming, Device Drivers, embedded systems. These languages provide high performance and  are used when minimal resources usage is necessary, they are efficient in memory management. Moreover, they are fast to execute. In comparison, in certain instances, Rust can run as twice as fast as Python.

This comparison is appealing and developers are aware that low level programming languages are way faster than other middle or high level languages. This has loads of advantages to run a code faster especially in web development, such as:

- **Improved efficiency**: Tasks are done easier by a program, this allows users to accomplish more tasks in less time.
- **Improved User Engagement**: Users are more likely to stay engaged and explore further when pages load quickly, which improves User experience.
- **Higher conversion rate**: This is more e-commerce related,  faster websites lead to higher conversion rate, this improves sales and conversions.
- **Better search engines**: Faster search engines tend to be ranked higher and have more visibility, thus meaning a higher traffic. Mozilla Firefox was developed using Rust and is ranked amongst the top web browsers.
- **Cost savings**: faster web apps often consume fewer servers resources, a faster run time consumes less resources, meaning that run time is cheaper, especially for cloud platforms.

* **Faster loading time**: A faster website means fewer loading time, this has multiple advantages, meaning you can load a website even with an unstable connection, and thus on any platform, especially for mobile devices that tend to be more unstable than desktops. And this in a wider region, websites are then accessible globally even when your connection is unstable.

Secondly, Rust has a vast set of tools for web development that helps developers. Such as APIs, Frameworks, and WebAssembly support (Wasm). These tool scan be used by web developers to improve the quality of a web software, improve the efficiency and improve the speed of development.

WebAssembly being one of the best Compiler around for Web development. It allows code written in languages like C, C++ and most importantly Rust to run in web browsers at near-native speed.
We've just shown the importance of code efficiency and speed and Rust being compatible with WebAssembly is a huge advantage and not every languages are supported by WebAssembly, this is why this tool is appealing for web development.

Moreover, we've recently seen the emergence of APIs and Frameworks for Rust. Such as Actix-web or Rocket, both software are a set of APIs and Frameworks that were made specially for Rust.
APIs are necessary for Web development as they permit to link webpages and allow software to communicate between each other. They come with multiple advantages and permit the integration of functionality such as :

- Data integration
- Content management
- Functionality enhancing
- Improved UX
- Cross-platform computability
- Development efficiency

Furthermore, the fact that Rust comes with Frameworks is attractive for web developers, these sets of pre-built structures, tools and libraries designed to make the development of web pages and applications easier and faster to do are important when it comes to development, as developing becomes less time consuming, easier to develop and subsequently decreases the cost of development. These Frameworks provide a strong base for developers that they can rely on.
They impose a certain design that lessen the risks of mistakes while developing, and reusability to make it easier to develop repetitive tasks.
They make programs more consistent and improve the overall productivity and efficiency of both the developer and the software.

All these tools will improve the optimization of the program to make it even faster to execute and easier to develop while lessening the risks of human made mistakes while developing.

Thirdly, Rust and all it's tools allow Interoperability, meaning that other programming languages can be used along with Rust, a bit like how HTML and CSS are interoperable! Rust is designed to integrate and interact with code written in other web oriented languages,  such as:
- JavaScript,
- Python,
- HTML,
- CSS,
- PHP,
- RUBY

This wide Interoperability offers several advantages, linking Rust with other programming languages leverages Rust's performance, you can tackle Rust's few drawbacks by correcting them with other languages. This means once more performance optimization and efficiency all while lessening resource usage. Improving the benefice in high performance, real-time data processing and handling large volumes of data.

To conclude this part, Rust is already a fast and efficient Low level programming language. All the features and tools that come along with Rust are widely beneficial for web development and make fast executing and loading web applications, being compatible along all platforms, wherever you are. And that are interoperable with other languages. But you'd expect such a fast executing language to not be as good when it comes to security, right?

## Rust x Security

You'd expect such a fast executing language to have some drawbacks security wise, well it isn't quite the case for Rust. It has a strong emphasis on memory safety.
Firstly, Rust has an innovative approach to memory management and safety, and this is largely attributed to its Rust ownership system, but what is it exactly?
In the core of this ownership system, a set of rules are enforced by the Compiler, each value has its unique owner, and there can be only one at the time, value's memory are then managed clearly without any risk of duplicate data and bugs in the memory.
Moreover, such data can be borrowed, meaning you can access a value without transferring ownership. It enables multiple reads or temporary use of the value, like a loan in a bank. This set of rules are beneficial for Cybersecurity, they provide memory safety and prevent common issues like null pointers, data races and memory leaks, this contributes to stability and security in a program.
You can access multiple data without causing conflicts, reducing bugs and making it easier to use concurrent code, libraries, APIs etc..
Moreover, Rust uses no Garbage collector, unlike many other languages this makes Rust suitable for system programming where performance and control on memory usage is necessary

Secondly, Rust ecosystem is widely focused on security, the same tools that we've previously seen in this article such as Frameworks and APIs are emphasizing security, using these tools efficiently allow web developers to create even more secured web applications. Using frameworks allows the avoidance of common mistakes that can be easily done during the development process, re-using libraries that have already proven to be efficient and safe is a great thing for developers in order not to put human-made mistakes into their code, that will make their web site or web pages misbehaving once live.
Moreover, Rust's Compiler is catching bugs and errors at compile time rather than dealing with them at run time. This mean that these bugs will be caught by the environment before being put into machine code. An early detection of bugs is the best way to mitigate them in order to correct them as early as possible, so that you don't have to rework on a whole architecture by the end of the development, meaning that bug mitigation and maintenance costs are lessen.
Rust environment is a safe place for Web development. And the community is contributing to it.

Thirdly, Rust is a vast and open community handled language.
There's a huge community of developers that are present to develop Rust, in term of speed but as well as security. There's an open email address, that you can find on this website: <https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security>
You can report any bugs and ask questions about security concerns to a team of Rust developers that will answer any of your questions and sometimes even correct some of your bugs to make Rust a safer place for developers and for users. And you are guaranteed an answer under 48 hours, meaning that your development doesn't have to stop while you're waiting for an answer.
Moreover, there's a vast community of developers that are contributing to the community, they are posting some of their work online. They contribute on the creation of libraries, and are there when you need them to. This community is open to share knowledge, safe and secured code. This collective effort improves the overall security of Rust-based projects and this community is growing more and more everyday.

## Rust x The Future

It is clear that Rust is the future of Web development, its fast and secured execution is appealing. Rust has many advantages for little drawbacks and these drawbacks can easily be tackle by the Interoperability of the language. Meaning that other languages can fix Rust few existing issues.
Rust is a versatile language that emphasizes memory safety without compromising speed.
Rust's unique features hold a promising future, Rustusage will definitely grow in Web development for web application and web pages where memory safety and performance is necessary, it is playing a crucial role in Cybersecurity.
Its WebAssembly  integration is expanding rapidly, and the efficiency in compiling Wasm will contribute to the expansion of Rust usage for various domains especially for Web development.
Rust ownership system and concurrency enables safe and efficient parallel computing. Whenever parallelism is required, such as data processing and AI.
Rust is a fast growing and expanding language widely community driven, and the community grows each day a bit more, the language and databases is growing and maturing each day, being more and more precise. Even more secured.

## Conclusion

To conclude, Rust is still a new coming language even if it is 17 years old, Rust is a performant and optimized for Web development, it is appealing for so many reasons and web developers are being more and more aware of the many unique and ground-breaking features thatRust can provide. Its Ownership system and its near native speed when running is what every developer has ever dreamt of.
Rust is the future of Web development and the community is growing every single day, symbolizing the recognition that Rust is getting.
Even if in my opinion, Rust isn't already recognized as one of the best language for web development, I am pretty sure that it is a matter of time until Rust is one of the most used language in the world. It has so many advantages that it's sure that Rust will revolutionize the entire field.
You should definitely start learning Rust instead of learning other low-level programming language. Linus Torvalds when creating Linux entirely in Rust even said that C++ is a "shitty language".
So what are you waiting for?
