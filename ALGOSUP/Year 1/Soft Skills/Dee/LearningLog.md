## Day 1: Self-Reflection

Group performance can be measured to help us understand the importance of reducing inefficiencies within a team to maximize productivity. This helps identify issues within the team and find ways to enhance productivity.

We’ve learned about congruent communication, where body language matches words. This is critical as 90% of communication relies on body language. To communicate congruently, you need to maintain a realistic appreciation of yourself and a high sense of self-worth. You should never adopt a defensive stance or make others feel threatened, as this leads to defensive behavior and incongruent communication. I will work on my body language to make the audience as comfortable as possible by adopting a neutral stance, neither too far nor too close.

We also examined an art piece that was an optical illusion, leading some to see a young woman, others to see an old woman, and some to see both. Initially, I saw the old woman, but after a few seconds, I saw the young woman and couldn't see the old woman anymore. I realized it was about the point of view, and by looking at different points on the art piece, I could see both again. I then helped my teammates by sharing my perception and showing them how to see both characters depicted. This experience taught us that point of view is crucial and different perspectives can lead to confusion. Our mind tends to complete incomplete information, which can result in misunderstanding. I've learned to step back, communicate clearly, ask questions, and ensure discussions are thorough to avoid leaving gaps.

Effective communication requires balancing attention between self, others, and context. When under threat, this balance is disrupted, leading to ineffective communication. You always need to find a balance. I’ll try to never neglect my needs in a discussion, nor the other(s)’s need(s), and the context of a discussion, to ensure that communication remains effective and constructive. This can be done by asking questions, knowing your environment, and being attentive.

When dealing with dominant individuals, I’ve learned to acknowledge them politely and then redirect the focus to others. For instance, responding with "Thank you, but can we listen to the others and come back to you later?" can help manage the conversation and ensure everyone's contributions are heard.

To put everything into action, we roleplayed with my team, each having a different role for a conversation about an issue we had during the project. My role was "What you can do, I can do better!" This role didn’t reflect me at all, but I did my best to get into character. I had to interrupt others while they were talking, always questioning what they were saying to discredit them and redirect the discussion to myself without starting a point. I always had backup data or anything that could help prove my point and influence others to listen to me and adopt my way.

This caused a real issue in the discussion, as another member had the role of the experienced guy who believed they were better than anyone else. This led to a never-ending rise in tension between us, drifting us away from the original subject and preventing us from reaching any conclusion. It made the discussion a big mess, wasting time and resources. This exercise highlighted the importance of what we had just discussed: never put others, yourself, or the context apart. The communication was totally ineffective, and it was great to debrief as a team.

Through these reflections, I've gained valuable insights into improving my communication and team interaction skills. By applying these learnings, I aim to enhance my performance in group settings, ensure more effective and balanced communication, and maintain motivation and positive dynamics within my teams.

## Day 2: Influence and Feedback

There are many ways to influence people. Some methods are louder, some rely on position, and others on kindness. I believe it depends on the individual. Each person should use their own behavior and way of thinking to influence others, as this is the most natural way for them to do so. However, it's beneficial to improve on influencing methods that you're not comfortable with, as it gives you more ways to persuade people and consider different perspectives.

Gathering feedback from my teammates helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. The self-assessment aligned well with my true self. I am someone who always listens to others and encourages them to participate, even if they are shy or hesitant. People tend to listen to me because I am likable and supportive. I always try to be positive to help others make better decisions.

Influence is a two-way street; I comply with them, and they comply with me. I appreciate how the day went for the team, and they felt the same.

### Following the not-so-self-assessment, here are the results:

#### Existing Styles

- **Supporting Style:** At the beginning of the debate/discussion, I tried to monitor the discussion, playing a mediator role, encouraging people to give their opinion and the list they have done. Ensuring that they give their opinion and they don’t feel left behind by those that drive the discussion. I always try to make others laugh a bit, to have a lightweight atmosphere going on. I always listen to what others say, and ensure to give them feedback on what they say, always in a positive way to help them improve personally. I might not be the one that takes the most decisions but I always ensure that the one being taken is a group decision and that everyone feels included.

- **Need Fulfillment Style:** I always strive to help my team and others, ensuring that we follow and fulfill the client's requirements in a project. I consider how our work can benefit the end user. I think about what my peers in the team need and aim to show the best part of myself to support them and be a valuable asset. I listen to them and am sensitive to what they say. In today’s exercise, I kept the scope in mind, even if it wasn’t the one I decided on, because I believed it was the best decision for my teammates and the final idea. I always bring my teammates back to the subject when needed, ensuring the decision taken is the right one for the end person.

- **Rational Presentation Style:** I always keep the rational side of the conversation in mind by considering facts and providing them in my feedback. For instance, today I reminded my team that we should never comply with blackmailers, as it is proven that not following their demands is the key to counteracting them. This is something I use in my everyday life, as I believe it is always necessary to stay rational when influencing people to ensure healthy decisions.

#### Desired Additional Styles

- **Pushing/Driving Style**
- **Goal-setting Style**
- **Value-driven Style**

### How I Can Develop Them?

- **Pushing/Driving Style:**
  - Take on assertive roles: Volunteer for leadership positions and voice your opinions confidently in meetings. Advocate for your ideas and push for beneficial outcomes respectfully.
  - Practice conflict resolution: Engage in conflicts constructively, negotiating compromises and ensuring all voices are heard while driving towards a resolution.
  - Set deadlines and follow through: Implement structured project management with clear deadlines. Communicate expectations and hold everyone accountable, addressing delays promptly.

- **Goal-Setting Style:**
  - Set clear objectives: Define and communicate SMART goals for each project to ensure everyone understands their targets.
  - Monitor progress and give feedback: Track project progress using tools, providing consistent feedback to keep the team aligned and motivated.
  - Use performance metrics: Establish KPIs to measure success and guide decision-making, sharing these metrics to show the impact of each team member’s contributions.

- **Value-Driven Style:**
  - Articulate values: Define and share your core values and those of your team, ensuring alignment. Reinforce these values in meetings and communications.
  - Incorporate values in decisions: Ensure decisions align with core values, considering their impact on teamwork and collaboration.
  - Inspire through actions: Lead by example, demonstrating behaviors that reflect your values. Celebrate and highlight instances where team members embody these values to build a strong, value-driven culture.

## Day 3: Conflict Management

Day 3 was more about understanding and managing a conflict within a team, with one or multiple other individuals or during daily life.

A conflict is the result of incompatible behavior between parties whose interests differ. It is a process where one party attempts to block or frustrate the efforts of another, preventing them from achieving their goals or furthering their interests. They happen every single day, under different circumstances or forms.

### Levels of Conflict:

- Intra-personal
- Interpersonal
- Inter-group
- Inter-organizational

Whenever we encounter a conflict, I think that it must be necessary to take a bit of time to understand what kind of conflict we are encountering. Take a step back, a deep breath and think, identify; it will help you while dealing with the conflict.

During a conflict, they are perceived differently between individuals. When it comes to conflicts that happen with more than one person, each action made by the other party may be felt as a threat, causing a negative reaction. Sometimes, you just can’t really explain it. Thinking about it, intra-personal conflicts can actually lead to this kind of perception.

I’ve got an example given by my step-dad, long story short: He used to make jokes to one of his coworkers every morning to lighten his day up and they usually laughed about it, until one morning, he didn’t laugh about it. His coworker had lost his mother. The loss of a loved one led to an intra-personal conflict, leading to an interpersonal conflict between my step-dad and his coworker.
I’ve got an example given by my step-dad, long story short: He used to make jokes to one of his coworkers every morning to lighten his day up, and they usually laughed about it, until one morning, he didn’t laugh about it. His coworker had lost his mother. The loss of a loved one led to an intra-personal conflict, leading to an interpersonal conflict between my step-dad and his coworker.

One way to resolve this conflict would have been to communicate about it directly to prevent any escalation and growing resentment. “Sorry, I just lost my mother, maybe it wasn’t the right time to make that joke.” Instead, the coworker didn’t say anything and didn’t talk to my step-dad all day long, leading to heavy confusion. Unresolved conflicts tend to grow bigger over time.

This is what happened as the lack of communication led to my step-dad and his coworker not talking to each other afterward after a quarrel. This is a perfect example of how simple it could have been to avoid this conflict, but yet at how complicated it is to avoid them. They always happen, every day. They could be resolved with a single sentence, yet they persist.

With a couple of videos watched during the day, we have learned new strategies to tackle and overcome conflicts. We’ve been introduced to the SCARF model, which outlines five domains that influence behavior in social situations:

- **Status**
- **Certainty**
- **Autonomy**
- **Relatedness**
- **Fairness**

These five key aspects are quite important when it comes to managing threat responses because they are double-edged swords. Indeed, let’s take the example of fairness: One employee has made more hours than he should have done, and the company has an overtime paid hours policy. The employee will be paid for his overtime hours. It’s fair to the employee; they are happy, and there are no conflicts.

However, let’s say now that the company has decided not to pay the employee even though he made overtime hours; it is unfair to the efforts made by the employee. He then complies with the HR department, which still refuses to pay him. The tension spirals up and leads to conflicts between the employee and the company.

Whenever one of the SCARF elements becomes negative, it can lead to conflict. When it comes to managing a threat response within a conflict, it is easy to act before thinking and regretting afterward. It is necessary to cool our nerves down before doing anything to prevent any regrets and disasters.

Threat response is always more powerful than the reward response. When people feel safe, it is obvious that they will be more efficient and productive, as well as more open. Making the door open to Relatedness, Status, Autonomy, and many other elements of the SCARF model is crucial.

It is necessary to self-regulate ourselves, take a step back, and identify which threat response has been triggered in ourselves, thus improving self-awareness and helping us think before any further action. Then, we can de-escalate the situation by simply identifying which SCARF domain has been triggered in the other person.

This can be done by asking other people how they feel. A simple way to express how you feel is the “I message.” Ensuring that the other person understood how you felt, why, and what they think should have been done differently, without anyone being blamed. This is what I think every individual should do during a conflict; there’s nothing more effective than this when it comes to conflict resolution. It takes only four sentences to understand where the issue is coming from, to de-escalate, and to try to find a solution for the future.

By following the SCARF model, it is easier to mitigate many conflicts before they even happen. Ensuring that each aspect of this model is respected is necessary when it comes to management and conflict resolution. It should always be kept in mind when working as a team to ensure that fewer conflicts will occur. And if they ever occur, there are simple yet effective ways to handle them; communication is key.

Today's focus on conflict management provided valuable insights into understanding and addressing conflicts effectively. The SCARF model and the importance of communication stood out as key takeaways. Moving forward, I will strive to apply these strategies in both personal and professional settings to handle conflicts constructively.

## Day 4

This day was centered around the conception of a cartoon. Each team was responsible for a part of the cartoon, and my team was in charge of the introduction. Beforehand, each team had created a plot and three characters. It was decided by voting which plot we would keep, and we chose one character from each of the three remaining teams to ensure everyone felt involved in the creation of the cartoon, as at least one element was made by each team. This idea was suggested by Elone, and it was a great one because everyone felt related to the story in some way.

In our team, we named a "Project Manager" who was responsible for allocating tasks and communicating with the heads of other teams. However, we ended up communicating with the others in various ways, both orally and via Slack, whenever we had a query or any doubt about the story.

During this day, I noticed the relevance of everything discussed the day before regarding conflicts, communication, influence, etc. Thanks to the self-assessment, I knew that my influence style is the supporting style. During the process of co-creating the cartoon, this led me to help push others when they were slacking or whenever they needed support. I was always behind someone, listening and giving valuable insight to help them feel supported and motivated, while keeping in mind the final outcome we needed to deliver. This day really confirmed the self-assessment made two days earlier.

I didn’t notice major conflicts between teams or individuals, but one issue that arose was the heat in the room. Myself and two other team members went into the corridor to write our story since we were responsible for it. This led to a lack of communication with the members responsible for the designs, creating gaps and voids in "conflicts" and leading to confusion and mistakes. We were not as effective as we could have been. Next time, we will ensure to discuss every aspect together first and then move to different rooms if a communication strategy has been decided and applied.

In fact, there were no clear leaders in our team, nor in the whole group in general. It didn’t feel as if one individual had taken the lead of the whole process. I felt as if everyone was equal. However, I felt like one team was left behind during the process. This eventually led them to be late in the creation process, and I don’t think they are to blame. As was pointed out during the course, no one went to help them when they finished their own tasks. There was a lack of communication, and the SCARF model was indeed disturbed. I’m pretty sure that in the long term, this could have created bigger conflicts among the team.

## Conclusion: Applying Learning Points in the Process of Co-Creation

Based on my experiences over the past four days, I've identified several key learning points about managing communication, conflict, and influence within teams. Here’s how these insights can be effectively applied in the process of co-creation:

1. **Congruent Communication:**  
   Congruent communication ensures that verbal and non-verbal cues align, fostering trust and clarity. In co-creation, maintaining congruent communication is vital to avoid misunderstandings and to ensure everyone feels heard and respected. For example, when discussing ideas, matching positive body language with encouraging words helps in creating a supportive environment where team members are more likely to share their thoughts.

2. **Perspective Taking:**  
   Understanding that people may perceive the same situation differently is crucial. During co-creation, actively seeking and valuing different perspectives can lead to richer, more creative outcomes. This means encouraging team members to share their viewpoints and taking the time to explore and understand these perspectives, as seen in the optical illusion exercise.

3. **Balanced Attention:**  
   Effective communication requires balancing attention between self, others, and the context. In co-creation, ensuring that everyone’s needs and the project's requirements are considered prevents any imbalance that might lead to conflict. This can be achieved by setting clear objectives, regularly checking in with team members, and adjusting plans as needed to accommodate everyone's input.

4. **Managing Dominant Individuals:**  
   Acknowledging and politely redirecting dominant individuals ensures that all voices are heard. During co-creation, this helps in maintaining a democratic process where every team member's contribution is valued. For instance, if someone dominates the conversation, gently steering the discussion back to quieter members encourages inclusive participation.

5. **Supporting and Encouraging Team Members:**  
   Using a supporting style, as identified in my self-assessment, helps in building a positive team dynamic. During co-creation, this means actively listening, providing positive feedback, and ensuring that everyone feels included and valued. Supporting teammates, especially when they are struggling, helps maintain morale and fosters a collaborative atmosphere.

6. **Clarity and Feedback:**  
   Clear communication and constructive feedback are essential. In co-creation, providing specific, actionable feedback helps in refining ideas and improving the overall quality of the output. Regularly updating each other on progress and addressing any issues promptly keeps the project on track.

7. **SCARF Model:**  
   Applying the SCARF model helps in managing threat responses and ensuring a positive team environment. During co-creation, being mindful of Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness ensures that everyone feels safe and motivated. For example, providing clear roles (Certainty), allowing creative freedom (Autonomy), and ensuring fair recognition of contributions (Fairness) can significantly enhance the team's performance.

8. **Conflict Resolution:**  
   Addressing conflicts promptly and effectively prevents escalation. During co-creation, creating an open environment where team members feel comfortable voicing concerns helps in resolving issues before they become major problems. Using "I messages" to express feelings and needs can help in de-escalating tensions and finding mutually acceptable solutions.

9. **Structured Communication:**  
   Implementing a structured communication strategy, as highlighted during the cartoon creation, ensures that everyone stays aligned. Regular team meetings, clear documentation, and defined communication channels (e.g., Slack) help in maintaining clarity and reducing confusion. This prevents the kind of miscommunication experienced due to the physical separation of team members.

10. **Leadership and Equal Participation:**  
    While clear leadership can guide the process, ensuring equal participation is crucial. During co-creation, rotating leadership roles or adopting a flat hierarchy where everyone has an equal say can prevent any single team from feeling left behind, as observed in the cartoon project.

By applying these learning points, co-creation processes can become more effective, inclusive, and harmonious. Each team member's contributions will be valued, conflicts will be managed constructively, and the overall output will benefit from diverse perspectives and collaborative effort. This approach not only enhances the quality of the project but also fosters a positive and productive team environment.

**Note:** I hope that it wasn’t too overwhelming for you to read through, but I heard that last time there was not enough information and thinking about what had been done. I’ve let my brain rest for a few days before writing most of this in order to take a step back and have a better point of view on the event of the week.

I’d like to thank you for this introduction to new strategies that will be useful in both my personal life and my professional life. (I’ve already used some of the strategies for conflict resolution in my personal life since you’ve introduced them to us.)
