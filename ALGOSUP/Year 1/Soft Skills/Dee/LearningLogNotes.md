Day 1:
Note taking: 

Group Performance Equation:
Group Performance = Potential Productivity - Loss due to Group Process

Congruent Communication:
Consistency between body language and words is crucial.
Key Point: 90% of comprehension is body language, the rest is words.
Requirements:
Realistic self-appreciation (respect yourself despite weaknesses)
High sense of self-worth
Defensive Stance: When people feel threatened, they communicate incongruently.

Perception:
Effort to explain viewpoints clearly is necessary for mutual understanding.
Point of View: Different perspectives can lead to confusion.
Mind Completion: Our minds fill in gaps, leading to possible miscommunication.
Strategy: Stand back, communicate clearly, ask questions, and avoid leaving gaps.

Tone:
Components: Pace, volume, emphasis
Example:
"I didn’t SAY you were stupid."
"I didn’t say YOU were stupid."
"I didn’t say you were STUPID."
Emphasis changes meaning.

Fluency:
Consider formal vs. informal language, immediacy, and speech accommodation.

Body Language:
Components: Use of space, eye movements, gaze, posture, relative body positioning, gestures
Space: Maintain comfortable distance.
Eye Contact: Essential for feeling listened to and building relationships (culturally dependent).

Balance in Communication:
Three Areas:
Self
Others
Context
Effective communication requires balance, especially when not threatened.

Motivation:
Integration: Bring feelings to work as they are necessary for communication and motivation.

Handling Dominant Individuals:
Strategy: Politely acknowledge ("thank you") and redirect focus to others. Avoid returning to the dominant individual’s point.

Day 3: Understanding and Managing Conflict
Definition of Conflict
Conflict is the result of incompatible behavior between parties whose interests differ. It is a process where one party attempts to block or frustrate the efforts of another, preventing them from achieving their goals or furthering their interests.
Levels of Conflict
Intra-personal: Conflicts within an individual, such as conflicting goals and needs (e.g., role conflicts).
Interpersonal: Conflicts between two or more individuals, often due to differences in personality, opinions, interests, or levels of commitment.
Inter-group: Conflicts arising from group issues and group goals.
Inter-organizational: Conflicts between different organizations.
Perception of Conflict
If you perceive a conflict, every action by the other party may feel like a threat, causing you to react negatively.
Communicate to resolve conflicts early to prevent escalation and growing resentment.
Unresolved conflicts tend to grow bigger over time.
SCARF Model
The SCARF model outlines five domains that influence behavior in social situations:
Status: Feeling important and respected reduces status pressure and helps people thrive.
Certainty: Providing clarity and certainty allows people to make better decisions.
Autonomy: Giving people control over their environment and ownership of their work enhances their sense of autonomy.
Relatedness: Fostering a sense of belonging and making people feel accepted, listened to, and valued.
Fairness: Ensuring fairness between effort and reward.
Managing Threat Responses
Threat Response vs. Reward Response: The threat response is more powerful than the reward response. Making people feel safe can open them up to be more efficient and productive.
Self-Regulation: Identify which threat response has been triggered in you to improve self-awareness and think before acting.
De-escalation: Identify which SCARF domain has been triggered in the other person to help de-escalate the situation.
Communication and Conflict Resolution
Talk to People: Ask how they feel to understand their perspective and address issues early.
Empathy in Action: Abraham Lincoln’s quote, “I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better,” highlights the importance of understanding others to resolve conflicts.
Key Strategies
Make People Feel Safe: They will be more open and efficient.
Acknowledge Past Experiences: Even the smallest experience can be valuable.
Encourage Autonomy: Stop micromanaging and allow people to manage their own work.
Create a Sense of Belonging: Make people feel like part of a team or family.
Ensure Fairness: Align work input with rewards to maintain fairness.
By following these strategies, we can manage conflicts more effectively and create a positive, productive environment.
