## Changes and evolution 

What did change in the last 10-15 years that impacted APIs and communication?

In the last 10-15 years, the web has evolved a lot, thus bringing a need of change, especially when it came to optimizing the communication between a client and a server, as well as accepting a bigger number of users. And making it seemless to the end user. 
APIs were the key to this evolution.

Went from MPA to SPA, from synchronous to asynchronous, from monolithic to microservices, from REST to GraphQL.
Microservices also changed the way we build applications, making them more scalable and easier to maintain.
Cloud computing changed the way we deploy and manage applications, making them more accessible and cost-effective.
Smartphones changed the way we access the web, making it more mobile and accessible.
IoT changed the way we interact with the world, making it more connected and intelligent.

We use APIs for everything now, from social media to banking to healthcare.

They also changed the way social media platforms work, as well as the way we interact with them.

With your knowledge of other technologies and languages how did Node.js changed some paradigms?

Node.js changed the paradigm of backend development, enabling the use of JavaScript on the server side, which allowed developers to use the same language for both front and back end, simplifying the development process.

Asynchronous programming model of Node.js made it possible to handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications.

npm, the package manager for Node.js, made it easy to share and reuse code, which accelerated development and fostered a strong community.
