## Postman Headers

**For all requests:**

```
value: user
```

**For POST/PUT requests, also add:**

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Quick Test Flow

1. `POST /articles` - Create a product
2. `GET /articles` - Verify product exists
3. `POST /cart` - Add product to cart (use productId from step 1)
4. `GET /cart` - View cart with calculated balance

## Error Responses

- `403`: Missing `value: user` header or insufficient admin privileges
- `400`: Invalid data
- `404`: Product/item not found

**Note:** Product creation, modification, and deletion operations (marked with *) may require admin access beyond the basic user authentication.
