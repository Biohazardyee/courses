# Conditional and Iterative Structures

## Conditional Structures

Conditional structures allow a program to perform different actions based on whether certain conditions are met. In programming, this is typically achieved using `if-then-else` statements.

### General Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # block of instructions 1
    ...
elif condition2:
    # block of instructions 2
    ...
else:
    # block of instructions 3
    ...
```

### Example 1: Absolute Value Calculation

```python
x = float(input("Enter a value for x: "))
if x < 0:
    x = -x
print("The absolute value of x is", x)
```

### Example 2: Checking if an Integer is Even or Odd

```python
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("The input number is even")
else:
    print("The input number is odd")
```

### Example 3: Exam Result Based on Grade

```python
note = float(input("Enter the general average: "))
if note < 8:
    print("Student failed")
elif note < 10:
    print("Student can retry")
else:
    print("Student passed")
```

### Nested Conditionals

A conditional block can contain another conditional, which is useful for handling multiple related tests.

**Example: Solving a First-Degree Equation**

```python
a = float(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = float(input("Enter the value of b: "))

if a == 0:
    if b == 0:
        print("Infinite number of solutions")
    else:
        print("No solutions")
else:
    print("Unique solution:", -b / a)
```

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator allows for concise conditional assignments.

**Syntax:**  
`expression1 if condition else expression2`

**Examples:**

Assigning a value:

```python
status = "underage" if age < 18 else "adult"
```

Printing based on a condition:

```python
print("underage") if age < 18 else print("adult")
```

## Iterative Structures

Iterative structures enable repeated execution of a block of code. The two main types are `for` and `while` loops.

### For Loop

A `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It iterates over a sequence of values, often generated by the `range()` function.

**Syntax:**

```python
for var in range(begin, end, step):
    # block of instructions
    ...
```

- `range(begin, end, step)` generates values from `begin` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive), incremented by `step`.
- Defaults: `begin=0`, `step=1`.

**Examples:**

- `range(6)` → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- `range(3, 8)` → 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- `range(3, 10, 2)` → 3, 5, 7, 9
- `range(6, 0, -1)` → 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

**Multiplication Table Example:**

```python
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i, "*", n, "=", i * n)
```

**Even Numbers Example:**

```python
for i in range(20, -1, -2):
    print(i)
```

### While Loop

A `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. The loop continues as long as a condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```python
while condition:
    # block of instructions
    ...
```

- The loop body should update variables involved in the condition to avoid infinite loops.

**Example: Integer Part of a Real Number**

```python
x = eval(input("Enter a real number: "))
n = 0
while n + 1 <= x:
    n = n + 1
print("The integer part of", x, "is", n)
```

### Nested Loops

Loops can be nested inside each other, regardless of type. Conditional and iterative structures can also be combined.

**Example: Multiplication Tables**

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print("Multiplication table of", i)
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print(i, "*", j, "=", i * j)
    print()
```

### Loop Control Statements

- `break`: Exits the loop immediately.
- `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next.

**Example with `break`:**

```python
for i in range(666):
    if input() == 'x':
        break
```

**Example with `continue`:**

```python
for i in range(10, 21):
    if i == 13:
        continue
    print(i)
```
